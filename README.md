Source code for [unexpected-go.com](https://unexpected-go.com)

This is a small collection of unexpected [golang](https://golang.org/) behaviors, 
none of them are (probably) bugs, they're just the way golang works. 

Some of these examples are useful to avoid potential bugs in your production code,
and others are just _funny_.

**Notice**: These examples are not trying to prove that golang is _wrong_, or that it
doesn't work properly. If you think (and you're probably right) that a behavior
is justified, please send us a PR updating the example with more information.
